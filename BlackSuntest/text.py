Around you is eternal darkness.
You awaken in the Kingdom of Eboncrest, a desolate realm where sun never rises, ensnared by unyielding darkness, the very essence of life is smothered beneath the weight of eternal night. Within the labyrinthine depths of twisted forests and crumbling citadels, the air hangs heavy with the stench of despair, and the cries of the tormented echo through the silent void.
In the suffocating grip of the Dark Emperor's tyranny, the downtrodden masses toil ceaselessly, their souls shackled to the abyss by the cruel whims of their malevolent ruler. Some among them cling to the flickering embers of hope, their spirits defiant against the encroaching shadows, while others succumb to the insidious allure of darkness, their hearts consumed by the promise of power and prestige.
Among the shadows that lurk in the kingdom's depths, the common folk eke out a meager existence, their lives a fragile thread woven between the darkness and the light. For those who choose to resist the temptations of the abyss, life is a constant struggle—a relentless battle against the forces that seek to extinguish their humanity.
Yet, for others, the allure of the dark is too potent to resist. They trade their souls for a taste of power, their hearts consumed by the insatiable hunger for dominion over their fellow man. In the twisted hierarchy of the Dark Emperor's court, they rise swiftly through the ranks, their ascent fueled by the blood of the innocent and the cries of the oppressed.
Amidst the bleak landscape of Eboncrest, where even the bravest souls falter and the light of hope flickers in the encroaching shadows, lies the heart of the kingdom—the Citadel of Shadows. Within its blackened walls, the Darkstone lies ensconced, a malevolent force that radiates with the echoes of ancient sorrows. Guarded by the watchful gaze of the Dark Emperor, the stone holds the key to unraveling the mystery of the sun's disappearance—a truth so profound that none dare to speak its name.
Yet, amidst the despair and decay, a glimmer of hope remains. For within the depths of darkness, there lies the promise of redemption. It is said that the Darkstone holds the secrets of the sun's absence, and with it, the power to restore light to the kingdom. As the shadows deepen and the darkness threatens to consume all, a lone soul emerges—a beacon of light in the endless night, destined to embark on a perilous journey to uncover the truth and reclaim the lost dawn of Eboncrest.
